SMART DUSTBINS - GARBAGE MONITORING SYSTEM:

In this project, smart bin is built on a microcontroller
based platform Arduino Uno board which is interfaced with GSM modem and Ultrasonic sensor.
Ultrasonic sensor is placed at the top of the dustbin which will measure the stature of the
dustbin. Arduino will be programmed in such a way that when the dustbin is being filled, the
remaining height from the threshold height will be displayed. Once the garbage reaches the
threshold level ultrasonic sensor will trigger the GSM modem which will continuously alert the
required authority until the garbage in the dustbin is squashed. Once the dustbin is squashed,
people can reuse the dustbin.

FIRE DETECTION IN LIVE CCTV CAMERA SURVEILLANCE:

Lately fire outbreak is common issue and the damage caused by these type of incidents is
tremendous toward nature and human interest. Due to this the need for application for fire
detection has increased in recent years. In this we proposed a fire detection algorithm based on
image processing techniques which is compatible in surveillance devices like CCTV and wireless
camera.

The algorithm uses RGB colour model to detect the colour of the fire which is mainly
comprehended by the intensity of the component R which is red colour. The growth of fire is
detected using sobel edge detection. Finally a colour based segmentation technique was applied
based on the results from the first technique and second technique to identify the region of
interest (ROI) of the fire. This can help in detecting a fire from live CCTV camera surveillance.

LIMITATIONS: 1. Accuracy is 80.64% which is much better but not 100% .

SMART CLASSROOMS:

SMART PARKING:

Due to the increase in the number of vehicles in the campus, parking problems are bound to
exist. This is due to the fact that the current park facility developed are unable to cope with the
influx of vehicles in the campus.
To alleviate the above mentioned problems, we have developed the smart parking system.
With the implementation of the smart parking system, patrons can easily locate and secure a
vacant parking space at any car park deemed convenient to them.
Vehicle ingress and egress are also made more convenient with the implementation of hassle
free payment mechanism.
